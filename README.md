 I'm Gilnei, a dedicated technology leader with a passion for developing innovative solutions and creating high-performing teams. Over my diverse career, I've worn many hats - from being a PHP Developer, Scrum Master, Product Owner to a successful Entrepreneur. I believe this cross-functional experience has uniquely positioned me to understand and navigate the many layers of successful project execution and business management. As a founder of an outsourcing company, I take pride in building a work culture that emphasizes ethical behavior, continual learning, assertive communication, and quality team development. My commitment to these values has fostered a work environment marked by low turnover rates and highly engaged, responsible teams. In addition to running my own company, I continue to serve as a Product Owner for a long-standing client, where I apply my skills in problem-solving and product management to drive business solutions, maintaining alignment across teams through consistent feedback and daily check-in meetings.

Skills: Agile Product / Project Management, PHP Developer
