Hello! I'm Gilnei, a dedicated technology leader passionate about developing innovative solutions and creating high-performing teams. Over my diverse career, I've worn many hats - from being a PHP Developer, Scrum Master, and Product Owner to a successful Entrepreneur. 

This cross-functional experience uniquely positioned me to understand and navigate the many layers of successful project execution and business management. As a founder of an outsourcing company, I take pride in building a work culture that emphasizes ethical behavior, continual learning, assertive communication, and quality team development. My commitment to these values has fostered a work environment with low turnover rates and highly engaged, responsible teams. 

In addition to running my own company, I continue to serve as a Product Owner for a long-standing client. I apply my problem-solving and product management skills to drive business solutions, maintaining alignment across teams through consistent feedback and daily check-in meetings.

I'm a strong advocate for remote work, having managed global teams across different time zones and experienced that for 10+ years!

I see myself as a bridge between technology and business, always striving to bring out the best in both to deliver successful outcomes. Whether crafting the perfect solution or building a world-class team, I am committed to driving growth and excellence.
